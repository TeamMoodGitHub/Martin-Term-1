# Martin-Term-1

## rfzou.me

### Plan overview
The final product will be a one-stop webpage for all the information an employer may want to know about me.


### Elements of the website
The website will need to include, at the very least:<br>
Landing page (Name, basic information, brief paragraph)<br>
Link to resume pdf<br>
Contacts page (email,Facebook, Linkedin, Github, etc..)<br>
Potential API usage to beef up resume<br>
# Responsive design - mobile

### Some optional elements, or things to consider for the future
Cover letter style expansion on work experience, education, technical skills, projects, etc..<br>
Implementation of github API to display projects<br> 
Blog-style section where I would comment on what Iâ€™m working on, school life, etc..

### Theme 
Still maintaining the tech-y theme, but not going for a full blown-out IDE code theme.<br>
The website will be more minimal with soft colors and easy navigation.<br>


### Technology
Client - HTML/CSS/JS <br>
Server - Node.js (if APIs are in use)

### Test change
This is a change to the README to commit via 
command line.<br>

This is a second addition for week-one only
